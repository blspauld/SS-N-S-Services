# SS-N-S-Services
This a a website I have been working on for a friends contracting business. Which I decided would also become my Code Louisville project. 
As far as the project in concerned it is completed. Containing all the required aspects. 
As far as being ready for actual use as a website itt still has a lot of work I need to do. There is a significant amount of content to be added to the portfolio page and as of currently the request services form does not actully send the form because I have not yet learned how to code that.
